# salt_banana

A mini project showing how to use saltstack for multiple minions following best practices (avoid duplication and littering of jinja conditionals in state files).

As infrastructure we use Vagrant and VirtualBox for ease of use, but same salt configuration could be applied on a real or virtual cluster of computers.

## WIP


How to safely accept the minion keys.

List all the minion keys as seen on the master:

----
$ vagrant ssh salt -c "sudo salt-key -F"
Unaccepted Keys:
fbsd:  44:55:04:dc:29:05:87:01:66:dc:4f:ca:3e:0d:63:39:77:52:65:11:89:96:38:b6:e1:27:9a:c7:9a:ef:3e:52
salt:  75:fb:1a:49:17:da:0d:51:d2:79:14:b2:bd:a8:68:ee:ee:61:85:de:ea:37:50:11:c9:bf:4a:c5:3f:bc:71:ab
ubu:  54:cb:b2:db:95:e1:b9:c8:b5:0a:14:64:ca:32:82:fb:e7:91:e8:a3:3d:f7:10:86:87:5b:a0:04:2f:67:0a:5d
----

We use SSH as an out-of-band mechanism to get the fingerprints and confirm that they are the same:

----
$ for v in salt fbsd ubu; echo $v; vagrant ssh $v -c "sudo salt-call --local key.finger"; end
salt
local:
    75:fb:1a:49:17:da:0d:51:d2:79:14:b2:bd:a8:68:ee:ee:61:85:de:ea:37:50:11:c9:bf:4a:c5:3f:bc:71:ab
fbsd
local:
    44:55:04:dc:29:05:87:01:66:dc:4f:ca:3e:0d:63:39:77:52:65:11:89:96:38:b6:e1:27:9a:c7:9a:ef:3e:52
ubu
local:
    54:cb:b2:db:95:e1:b9:c8:b5:0a:14:64:ca:32:82:fb:e7:91:e8:a3:3d:f7:10:86:87:5b:a0:04:2f:67:0a:5d
----

We can now safely accept

----
sudo salt-key -a salt,ubu,fbsd
The following keys are going to be accepted:
Unaccepted Keys:
fbsd
salt
ubu
Proceed? [n/Y] y

Automatically adding host names of minions once their key is accepted, via reactor :-)

Use the simple DNSMASQ daemon, that does both DNS and DHCP
